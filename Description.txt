*************FOR ENCODING****************


I.Arithmetic Coding
1. First line in file contains the sequence to be encoded.
2. Next n lines contain the symbols separated by space along with specific range separated by comma.
For example:
********
CABCDAC
A 0.0,0.1
B 0.1,0.5
C 0.5,0.7
D 0.7,1.0
********

II.Run Length Encoding
1. First line in the files contains the sequence to be encoded.
For example: 
********
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCBB
********

III.Golomb Coding
1. First line in the file contains the divident.
2. Second line in the file contains the divisor.
For Example: 
********
117
17
********

IV.Binary RLE
1. First line in the file contains the sequence to be encoded.
2. Second line in the file contains the number of bits in which the sequence is to be coded.
For example:
********
00000000000000000000111000010000101000001100000000000000000010100000
4 
********

V.Move To Front
1. First line in the file contains the sequence to be encoded.
For Example:
********
finisher
********

VI.Borrows Wheeler Theorem
1. First line in the file contains the sequence to be encoded.
For Example:
********
selvestyerstallone
********

VII.Tunstall Code
1. First line in the file contains the sequence to be encoded.
2. Second line in the file contains the number of bits in which the sequence is to be coded.
For example:
********
ababaaaabacacbaaa
4
********
Please Note: The bits needed for the encoding of the sequence must be greater than or equal to upper bound of number of letters in sequence ^ 0.5

VIII.LZ77
1. First line in the file contains the sequence to be encoded.
2. Second line in the file contains the search buffer length.
3. Third line in the filse contains the look ahead buffer length.
For example
********
cabarararrarabacbabrara
7
6
********
Please Note: The total window size is equal to the sum of search buffer length and look ahead buffer length.

IX. LZ78
1. First line in the file contains the sequence to be encoded.
For example
********
abracadabra
********

X. LZW
1. First line in the file contains the sequence to be encoded.
For example
********
cabarararrarabacbabrara
********

XI. Huffman Coding.
Will discuss tomorrow


*************FOR DECODING****************

The decoding of the file is possible only if it is compressed by this appication.
